During the creation of a new report, you can select parameters such as schedule type, share with specific users or share with domains. Once the report is created, it will appear in the list of reports mentioned above.

In the composition view, the user can edit the report and add new widgets by pressing the *Add Block* button. If we grab the widget from the title bar at the top, we will be able to move it. In the lower right corner of each widget, the cursor will change shape, allowing you to change the size of the widget.
